\section{Chapter 1: Basics}
\subsection{Chapter 1: Nonlinear Equations}



The two types of problems in this course are: 


\begin{itemize}
\item Nonlinear equations (several equations on one independent variable)
\item Partial differential equations (single equation with several independent variables)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Linear} equations have solutions like $y_1,y_2$ that can be combined using any $c \in \mathbb{R}$ like $y_1 + cy_2$.

\textbf{Example}: Bacteria in a dish with a lot of food, no deaths
\begin{itemize}
\item $b'(t) = r_bb(t), r_b > 0. r_b$ would be the rate of growth.
\item This is linear. Reason 1: $\frac{d}{dt}(y_1 +cy_2) = y_1' +cy_2' = r_b(y_1 +c_y2)$ since $y' = r_by(t)$, and same for y2.
\item Also, this works because the solution is $b(t) = b(0)e^{r_b t}$, so $b_1(t) + cb_2(t) = b_1(0)e^{r_b t} +cb_2(0)e^{r_b t} = (b_1(0) + cb_2(0))e^{r_bt}$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example}: \textbf{Logistic} equation: Bacteria in a dish with a lot of food, limited by carrying capacity $M$.
\begin{itemize}
\item $b'(t) = r_bb(t)[M-b(t)]$.
\item This is nonlinear. Reason: $\frac{d}{dt}(y_1' +cy_2') = y_1'+cy_2' = r_b[y_1 + cy_2][M-y_1-cy_2] = My_1+Mcy_2-y_1^2-2cy_1y_2 -cy_1^2y_2^2$
\item $\neq My_1 - y_1^2 + Mcy_2-c^2y_2^2$ because of the extra $-2cy_1y_2$ term.
\end{itemize}

Sidebar: Note that this equation $b' = r_bb[M-b]$ is \emph{separable}, so it can be solved.
\begin{itemize}
\item $\frac{db}{dt} = rb[M-b]$
\item $\frac{db}{b(M-b)} = r dt$
\item $\frac{1}{M }(\frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{M-b}) db = r dt$ after partial fractions work
\item $(\ln(b)-\ln(M-b)) = Mrt + C \Rightarrow \ln(\frac{b}{M-b}) = Mrt + C$
\item $\frac{b}{M-b} = e^{Mrt}e^{C}$
\item Initial conditions $b=b(0), t=0 \Rightarrow \frac{b}{M-b} = \frac{b(0)}{M-b(0)} e^{Mrt}$
\item  $b(1+\frac{b(0)}{M-b(0)} e^{Mrt}) = M \frac{b(0)}{M-b(0)} e^{Mrt}$
\item  $b(M-b(0)+b(0)e^{Mrt}) = M b(0) e^{Mrt}$
\item $b = \frac{Mb(0)e^{Mrt}}{M+b(0)[e^{Mrt} -1]}$
\end{itemize}


This logistic solution will taper off to M at some point. Note that $\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} b(t) = M$ since the non-exponential terms stop mattering.  Also $b(t) = M$ sticks as a constant solution or \textbf{equilibrium} immediately.  \emph{These equilibria tell us what matters - the long-term behavior of solutions!}

Another \textbf{Example}: Lotka-Volterra equation pairs: Bacteria (b) and bacteria-killing phages (p), with kill rate $k$.
\begin{itemize}
\item The ``product'' $k b(t)p(t)$ measures the interactions and kills resulting from this.
\item $b'(t) = r_b b(t) - k p(t) b(t)$, or the normal growht rate minus kill rate
\item $p'(t) = kp(t)b(t)$ since its population grows as it kills bacteria.
\item Equilibria include $b = 0, p = 0$ and $b = 0, p > 0$, since these are \emph{constant} solutions, or places where $b'(t) = 0, p'(t) = 0$.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Direction fields}, with vector pointing towards $\langle b'(t), p'(t) \rangle$ (TODO - I think) let us follow the arrows to determine the curve over time.  In this case, the bacteria will always go extinct.

\ 
However, if we add a new death rate term $-d_pp(t)$ so $p'(t) = -d_pp(t) + kp(t)b(t)$:
\begin{itemize}
\item We get an equilibrium at $b = \frac{d_p}{k}, p = \frac{r_b}{k}$. (Since $0 = b'(t) = rb - kpb, (\Rightarrow pk = r), 0 = p'(t)  -dp + kpb,(\Rightarrow bk = d)$)
\item But otherwise the solutions swirl around this point.  This is called a \textbf{cycle}.  TODO What is a \textbf{limit cycle}?
\end{itemize}

Note that there are systems where the ``solution particle'' neither reaches an equilibrium or cycles around one point.  The \textbf{Lorenz system} famously has this owl-eye shaped double attractor (an example of \textbf{strange sets}) where initially close particles diverge unpredictably if the constants $\rho, \sigma, b$ are chosen right:

\begin{itemize}
\item $x'(t) = \sigma(y-x)$
\item $y'(t) = x(\rho - z) - y$
\item $z'(t) = xy-bz$
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item TODO
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Chapter 1.2: PDEs}

Many methods of attack for PDEs

\begin{itemize}
\item Separation of variables
\item Power series (Note: did we actually touch on this?)
\item Fourier Transform
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example}: Standing wave, where one end of a rope is fixed.  
\begin{itemize}
\item Vertical displacement from a line of rope: $u(x,t)$ depends on where ($x$) and when ($t$t).
\item Rope's \textbf{wave equation} is $u_{tt} = v^2u_{xx}$, where $v$ is the ``constant wave speed'', and the others are the space, time partials.
\item Note that $u = \cos(vt)\sin(x)$ and $u = \sin(vt)cos(x)$ both work.
\item If you guess the solution has split variables like $u = X(x)Y(y)T(t)$, then, upon substitution and division by $X(x)Y(y)T(t)$, $\frac{\delta^2 u}{\delta t^2} = v^2 [\frac{\delta^2 u}{\delta x^2} + \frac{\delta^2 u}{\delta y^2}]$ yields $\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = v^2 [\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} ]$
\item This method may or may not work.  But if it does, it means that since $x, y, $ and $t$ are independent variables, each individual piece must be constant.
\item So, for example, if we know $\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -4\pi^2$, we can get to $X(x) = \sin(2\pi x)$
\item The wave equation is similar in 3D: $u_{tt} = v^2[u_{xx}+u_{yy}+u_{zz}]$, or using the Laplacian, $u_{tt} = v^2\nabla^2 u$.  Here, $u$ measures not displacement but expansion/compression of air at $(x,y,z)$, time $t$.
\end{itemize}


Using Fourier transforms helps turn difficult PDEs into an easier problem like an ODE.  \emph{Fourier transforms work best} when 
\begin{itemize}
\item The domain is all of $\mathbb{R}^n$
\item The function $u$ vanishes at infinity.
\end{itemize}
 
The Fourier transform changes the domain of $x$ to that of $\omega$.  It comes with the (highly simplified) rule (see Vector Calculus course): $F[\frac{\delta f}{\delta x}] = i \omega F[f]$.  
\textbf{Example}: Drunkard's walk.
\begin{itemize}
\item One dimensional: moves left or right in a random way.  Starts at $x=0, t=0$.
\item $u(x,t)$ is probability of being at point $x$ at time $t$.  Naturally, $\int_{x=-\infty}^{x=\infty} u(x,t)dx = 1$.
\item Also, it obeys the 1-dD diffusion equation $\frac{\delta u}{\delta t} = \frac{\delta ^2 u}{\delta x^2}$
\item The Fourier transform doesn't affect $t$ at all.
\item So by taking Fourier transform of both sides of diffusion equation we get 
\begin{itemize}
\item $F(u_t)=  \frac{\delta}{\delta t} F(u) $ since $F$ doesn't care about $t$.
\item $\frac{\delta ^2 u}{\delta x^2} = i\omega F(\frac{\delta u}{\delta x}) = -\omega^2 F(u)$
\item So $  \frac{\delta}{\delta t} F(u)  = -\omega^2 F(u)$
\item This is solvable as $F(u) = ce^{-\omega^2 t}$.  Take it on faith that $c = \frac{1}{2\pi}$ for now. TODO
\item Known fact: $F[Ae^-{\frac{ax^2}{2}}] = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2 \pi a}} Ae^{\frac{-\omega^2}{2a}}$
\item This means $t = \frac{1}{2a}$ and $a = \frac{1}{2t}$
\item $F(u)  = 	\frac{1}{2\pi}e^{-\omega ^2 t}, F[Ae^-{\frac{ax^2}{2}}] = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2 \pi a}} Ae^{\frac{-\omega^2}{2a}}$ so $u  = Ae^{\frac{-ax^2}{2}}$
\item Solving, you get $A = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4\pi t}}, a=\frac{1}{2t}$, so $u(x,t) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4\pi t}} e^{-\frac{x^2}{4t}}$
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}


\section{Chapter 2: Nonlinear Equations}

Major ideas:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{phase plane}: TODO
\item \textbf{nullcline}: TODO
\item \textbf{direction field}: TODO
\item \textbf{equilibria}: TODO
\end{itemize}
 
\textbf{Example}: Bacteria vs. phages (again)
\begin{itemize}
\item Bacteria unrestrained grow in proportion to their population, so $\frac{db}{dt} = r_b b(t)$ (solved: $b(t) = b(0)e^{r_b t}$)
\item Phages unfed decrease in proportion to current size, so $\frac{dp}{dt} = -d_p p(t)$  (solved: $p(t) = p(0)e^{-d_p t}$)
\item Bacteria die with likelihood of meeting a phage, and phages increase with likelihood of meeting a bacterium.  So the set of equations, for constant $k$, becomes:
\begin{itemize}
\item $b'(t) = r_b b(t) - kb(t)p(t)$
\item $p'(t) = -d_p p(t) + kb(t)p(t)$
\item \emph{The product of p and b makes our equations nonlinear} (WHY?)
\item I guess, very generally, $b_1p_1 = k, b_2p_2 = k,$ but $(b_1+b_2)(p_1+p_2) = b_1p_1 + b_2p_2 + b_1p_2+b_2p_1 = 2k + b_1p_2+b_2p_1 \neq 2k$, so the last two ``mixed'' terms mean you can't just add solutions $(b_1, p_1)$ and  $(b_2, p_2)$.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

General thoughts on this solution:
\begin{itemize}
\item So a solution $(b(t), p(t))$, traces out a curve on the bp-phase plane (b is x-axis, p is y-axis) as time (unrepresented in the plane) continues.
\item If we add a unit tangent vector at every point $(B, P)$ aligned with $(b'(t), p'(t)) = ( r_bB - kBP, -d_p P + kBP)$, we can follow the arrows to see the solution over time.
\item The above is called a \textbf{direction field}
\item This is sometimes hard to sketch analytically, so we can look to the \textbf{nullclines}: places where one of the components of the direction field is zero.
\item In this case, $r_bB - kBP = (r_b-kP)B = 0$ when $P = 0$ or $P = \frac{r_b}{k}$, and $-d_p P + kBP = (kB-d_p)P = 0$ when $P=0$ or $B = \frac{d_p}{k}$.
\item The \textbf{upshot of nullclines} (since we don't care about $P, B \leq 0$): The lines $B = \frac{d_p}{k}, P = \frac{r_b}{k}$ \emph{divide the plane into pieces where the components of this (continuous) function pair can't change sign}.  
\item For instance, $B > \frac{d_p}{k}, P <  \frac{r_b}{k}$  means $r_b b - kbp > 0, -d_p p+ kdp > 0$, so both populations are growing here.  This helps to sketch the curve.
\item The curve looks like a counterclockwise whirlpool around the $(B, P) = ( \frac{d_p}{k}, \frac{r_b}{k})$.  (bacteria grow with low but growing phages; bacteria decrease as phages overwhelm; both decrease as phages starve; bacteria start coming back)
\item The center point is a (constant \textbf{equilibrium}) solution, and other solutions swirl around it but don't get attracted or repelled.
\end{itemize}

There are a few types of equilibria:
\begin{itemize}
\item This one is a \textbf{center} around which solutions circle.
\item A \textbf{stable equilibrum} would see small upsets come back to an unchanging state.
\item An \textbf{unstable equilibrum} would see small upsets create wildly divergent paths.
