Screensavers have captivated [this] man since the 1990s. If watched long enough, what will the spirits of the machine tell us?

Specifically, the question of whether a bouncing rectangle will slide \emph{exactly} into the corner of the screen, for a satisfying, perfectly diametric rebound, was even addressed on \emph{The Office}
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOtuX0jL85Y}{(link)}.

However, though these characters reportedly watched this sleep-mode drama play out for years until payoff, we ask - under what conditions will the rectangle \emph{definitely} perfectly bounce into the screen's corner?

\subsection{Statement} 
Suppose we have a screen of length $l$, height $h$, containing an axis-aligned rectangle of length $j$ and height $k$ centered at point $(x, y)$.

Suppose this rectangle is launched at direction $\langle 1, m\rangle$ \footnote {Think of this as slope $m$} and ``bounces'' according to billiard rules \footnote{Glancing off a horizontal boundary, our trajectory goes from $\langle 1, m \rangle$ to $\langle 1, -m \rangle$, with $\langle \pm 1, m \rangle$ to $\langle \mp 1, m \rangle$ for a horizontal one}.

Given $l, h, j, k, m \in \mathbb{R}$, can we tell whether the rectangle ever bounce perfectly into a corner?  

We can approach this problem from the simplest version to the most complex.

\subsection{Problem 1} 

Suppose $j = k = 0$ and $x = y = 0$. In other words, suppose we have a \emph{point} starting at the bottom left corner
 (origin).  Under what conditions (i.e. choice of $m$) does this bounce into a corner?


\subsection{Problem 2} 

Suppose $j, k > 0, x = \frac{j}{2}, y = \frac{k}{2}$. In other words, suppose we have a rectangle starting at the bottom left corner. Under what conditions does this bounce into a corner?

\subsection{Problem 3} 

Suppose we have maximally open (reasonable) conditions, with $x \in [\frac{j}{2}, l - \frac{j}{2}], y \in [\frac{k}{2}, h - \frac{k}{2}]$ (that is, a $j \times k$ rectangle fitting entirely in the screen). Under what conditions does this bounce into a corner?
